# ImageClassificationSVM
This repository contains the code for my final project of the course in Convex Optimization at the University of Oulu. The file `landscapeMain.m` contains the
code you should run to test the landscape classification and `MNISTmain.m` contains the code for the handwriting recognition.

If the code does not work, you probably have to download the files `LandscapeData.mat` and `MNISTdata.mat`. They contain the data for the problems
and are stored using the Git LFS format so this causes problems if you don't have git lfs installed.
